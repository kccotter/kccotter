Founder of Mano | Software Engineer | Building Technology for Labor Equity

I’m the founder of [Mano](https://www.joinmano.com), a mobile platform that helps employers connect with day laborers through real-world QR check-ins, nonprofit-backed worker validation, and built-in escrow for safe, fast payment. Mano launched its private beta in July 2025. We are actively partnering with nonprofits, onboarding workers, and preparing for our first public rollout in the Bay Area.

Before founding Mano, I was a software engineer at Amazon Music, where I worked on the wearables team focused on making Amazon Music a ubiquitous experience. Our goal was to ensure users could access their music seamlessly across any device, with a consistent interface and functionality, whether they were using smartwatches, fitness trackers, or headphones.

Prior to that, I worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I held Q-level security clearance and contributed to national security research. I developed Python tools for high-performance physics simulations and helped lead machine learning workflows to optimize fusion experiments.

I studied computer science with a concentration in software engineering and took additional coursework in electrical engineering. I grew up between the U.S. and Panama and care deeply about using technology to serve working-class and immigrant communities.

I believe technology should work for the people who are often left out of its design. I’m currently focused on building systems that create real-world access, dignity, and opportunity for overlooked workers.
